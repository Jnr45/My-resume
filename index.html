        <h3><u>Here is some things that I have accomplished in my career.</u></h3>
        <p>
         <ul>
            <li>
            2016- During my time at VWV I was part a team who were tasked in creating a pitch to commemorate 50 years of Botswana's Independency. We won the pitch and had to move to Botswana for an entire month put everything together and I went from being a runner to artist management <br>
            During the same year I was able to help pull off the DSTV Delicious Festival, learning how to plan structure and hold performers to account and stick to time according to the schedule.
            <br>
            During the Legendary Iconic Jazz Musicians bra <strong> <u>BRA HUGH MASEKELA's,</u> </strong> set, I came to find out the true magic in putting an event together is when you get to steal a moment during the event and see how much the people who you did all of this for are enjoying themselves.
            </li>
            <li> 2018 -  as a marketing consultant for Alteram, I was tasked with training and assisting the main labour center in Pretoria on what was then their new system in relation to COIDA, (Compensation of Injuries and Diseases Act), the labour division that looks to ensure that all employers in the country comply to the rules and regulations to cover their employees for any incidences on the job(insurance scheme). <br>
            While there I was able to out perform my team and ensure that we never had any long lines as our role was to ensure that employers were able to register, make online payment and get their letter of good standings. This also pushed me to learn more about the labour systems and practices and where I saw a customer brewing I intervened before it became and issue and help them structure their documents and questions to as to get assisted quickly and effortlessly.
            </li>
            <li>
                During my varsity years, thanks to two amazing friends of mine I was introduced to a company called Isilumko. Here I started my work life journey as a promoter and from here is where I was able to put some of the skills I learned in varsity and gather more that no book can teach.  <br> This experience helped me understand consumer behaviour how to read people from a far and how to present my self to them to make a sale. This approach helped me close a lot of sales.
